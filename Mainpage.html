      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Chateau Rose Café is an upscale cafe and tavern open every Wednesday
        evening from 7:30 PM RT - 9:00 PM RT. Though the cafe may have white
        linen table cloths, people from all walks of life and every social class
        are welcome to attend the weekly openings for a great opportunity to
        socialize and network! Enjoy divine food and drinks, beautiful melodies
        from our professional bards, and top class service from our talented
        wait staff. You might even catch a special performance while you're
        there! The cafe is always looking to expand our roster of waiters,
        bards, barkeeps, and security staff, so if you are looking for work in
        one of those capacities, consider joining us for competitive pay and a
        friendly work environment!

      <h2>Location</h2>
      <p>
        The chateau is located in Cathedral Square of Stormwind City; however, A
        Hero's Welcome in Dalaran (Legion) serves as our proxy location. You can
        access this Dalaran by using the hearthstone obtained in the Warlords of
        Draenor expansion, which is an easy and quick way to get to the tavern.
        For IC purposes, we are in Stormwind City and the chateau has no
        relation to either Dalaran or A Hero's Welcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chateau is divided into three sections: the ground floor, the upper
        floor, and the beer garden. All three of these sections are fully
        serviced by the chateau and there should ideally be a member of wait
        staff in each of the sections. Any special performances will occur in
        the beer garden. The kitchen is included on the ground floor, though the
        kitchen should be inaccessible to patrons. There is an administrative
        office on the upper floor; however, the chateau does not extend into the
        Greymane Enclave area. Basically, if you enter the Greymane Enclave zone
        on your map, you've left the area serviced by the chateau.
